# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data by formulating questions around the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#1 /* Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? */
SELECT 
    artist_name,
    popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#2 /* What artist released the longest song? */
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name as longest_song,
    duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1; 

#3 /* What artist released the shortest song? */
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name as shortest_song,
    duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms asc
LIMIT 1;

#4 /* What is the average danceability of Harry Styles' songs? */
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name like 'Harry Styles';

#5 /* What is the average duration of the 10 most popular songs? */
SELECT AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
